# Replit Support Ticket - Database Migration Infrastructure Issue

## Issue Summary
**Subject**: Platform Infrastructure Issue - Database Migration Service Failure During Deployment

**Priority**: High - Production deployment blocked by platform service

**Issue Type**: Platform Infrastructure / Database Services

## Technical Details

### Error Description
```
Database migrations could not be applied due to an underlying platform issue on Replit's infrastructure
The deployment build completed successfully but failed during the migration setup phase
This is a known platform-level error that prevents database schema updates from being processed
```

### Project Information
- **Project Name**: Skify AI Video Transformation Platform
- **Repl Owner**: M. Suresh Kumar (kumarsuresh84678@gmail.com)
- **Contact**: support@skifymagicai.gmail.com
- **Project Status**: Production-ready, fully functional in development environment

### Deployment Configuration
- **Application Type**: Full-stack JavaScript (Node.js/Express + React)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (provisioned via Replit)
- **Migration Tool**: Drizzle Kit with `npm run db:push` command
- **Build Status**: ✅ Successful - all application code builds correctly
- **Migration Status**: ❌ Failed - platform infrastructure prevents execution

### Environment Details
- **Node.js Version**: As specified in Replit environment
- **Database Connection**: `DATABASE_URL` environment variable configured and accessible
- **Migration Command**: `drizzle-kit push` (push-based schema synchronization)
- **Development Status**: Database schema working perfectly in development environment

### Database Schema Information
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with TypeScript
- **Schema Location**: `./shared/schema.ts`
- **Migration Strategy**: Push-based migrations (not file-based)
- **Tables**: Users, video_uploads, templates, render_jobs, payments, audit_logs with proper relationships

### Steps Already Taken
1. ✅ Verified database connection and accessibility
2. ✅ Confirmed DATABASE_URL environment variable is properly set
3. ✅ Tested database operations in development environment successfully
4. ✅ Verified Drizzle configuration and schema definitions
5. ✅ Confirmed build process completes without errors
6. ✅ Reviewed deployment logs showing platform-level migration failure

### Expected Behavior
- Database migrations should execute successfully during deployment process
- Schema should be applied to production database
- Application should deploy and become accessible

### Actual Behavior
- Deployment build completes successfully
- Migration phase fails with platform infrastructure error
- Deployment process terminates without completing

### Business Impact
- **Production Launch Blocked**: Cannot deploy production-ready application
- **Customer Access**: Unable to provide service to end users
- **Development Complete**: All code development finished, only deployment blocked

### Request for Support
We need Replit platform engineering team to:
1. **Investigate** the database migration infrastructure service
2. **Identify** the platform-level issue preventing migration execution
3. **Resolve** the underlying infrastructure problem
4. **Confirm** when deployment migrations are functional again

### Additional Information
- **Development Environment**: Working perfectly with full database functionality
- **Code Quality**: Production-ready with comprehensive testing
- **Dependencies**: All properly installed and configured
- **Deployment Readiness**: 100% ready except for platform migration service

- **Preferred Contact**: Email for technical updates

## Urgency Justification
This is a platform infrastructure issue preventing a production-ready application from deploying. The application development is complete and thoroughly tested, but blocked solely by Replit's database migration service malfunction.

**Note**: This is a platform service issue, not an application code problem. Development environment works perfectly, confirming the issue is with Replit's deployment infrastructure.
