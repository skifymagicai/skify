## Overview

- **Brand:** Skify  
- **Contact:** skifymagicai@gmail.com  
- **Founder:** M. Suresh Kumar  
- **Vision:** Empower global creators with streamlined AI-driven video remixing, balancing innovation, compliance, and scale.

## Mission & End-to-End User Experience

1. **User provides a viral video** (via direct upload or link).
2. **AI extracts the entire style** from the viral video including:
   - Aspect ratio, clip timing, and sequence
   - Speed ramps and slow-motion segments
   - Color grading and filter profiles
   - Transitions, visual effects, overlays
   - Text/lyrics style: font, size, position, animation specifics
   - Audio analysis: BPM, beat mapping, music cue points
   - Background changes and masking if present

3. **User uploads their own footage or photos** (single or multiple files).
4. **AI applies the extracted viral template** fully to the user’s media:
   - Cuts and splits the user media matching the viral clip timestamps
   - Matches speed changes, transitions, color grading, visual effects with identical timing
   - Auto-adds all text overlays, matching font, size, position, and animation with live preview overlay
   - Applies precise music and beat mapping syncing
   - Performs background swaps using AI masking if needed

5. **Output:**  
   - A ready-to-post, fully restyled viral video, mirroring original style, energy, and structure in just a few clicks.
   - *Pro users* can instantly “Enhance to 4K Ultra HD” cinematic export.
