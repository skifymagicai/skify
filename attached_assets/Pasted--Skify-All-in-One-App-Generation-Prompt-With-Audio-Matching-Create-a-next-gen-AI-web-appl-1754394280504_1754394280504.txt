## 🚀 Skify All-in-One App Generation Prompt (With Audio Matching)

**Create a next-gen AI web application called “Skify” (support: skifymagicai@gmail.com)**  
A production-grade SaaS platform for AI-powered video style transformation with modern UI and robust, real AI backend.

### **MISSION**

- Instantly analyze any viral short-form video (Reel, TikTok, YouTube Short).
- Automatically extract and separate all style components:
  - Effects (filters, overlays)
  - Templates (layout/structure)
  - Transitions (scene cuts, boundaries)
  - Color Grading (LUTs, palettes, tone)
  - Camera Movements (pans, zooms, tracking)
  - **Audio Matching:** Extract audio from the imported/video-to-analyze file, and allow users to apply and perfectly synchronize this audio with the timing of their own uploaded video.
  - AI Edits (auto-cuts, sequencing)
- Auto-generate reusable, remixable style templates
- Users upload videos and apply templates in ONE CLICK—broadcast-quality output, no editing skills needed

### **BACKEND & AI PIPELINE**

1. **Video & Audio Upload & Processing**
   - REST API for upload (MP4/MOV/AVI/WebM, max 500MB/10min)
   - Integrate Cloudinary or S3 for CDN and encrypted global storage
   - Background queue (BullMQ/Redis or serverless) for AI/FFmpeg/audio tasks

2. **True AI Style & Audio Analysis**
   - On upload, analyze using best-in-class APIs: RunwayML, Gemini, Replicate, FFmpeg
   - Extract effects, transitions, LUTs, camera movements, AI edits **and extract the original audio file**
   - Store all extracted info as JSON

3. **Audio Matching & Replacement Engine**
   - When user chooses a style/template, enable option:
       - “Apply original video’s audio to my own video”
   - Backend uses FFmpeg or similar to:
     - Export audio from source video (with accurate timing)
     - Overlay/sync this audio onto user's target video file
     - Ensure perfect alignment to video duration, using stretch/trim if needed
   - Make audio replacement the default or user-toggle feature in “Apply Style” process
