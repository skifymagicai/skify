Create a modern, clean web app dashboard interface titled “Skify – AI Video Transform.” The design should be minimalistic, professional, and inspired by leading SaaS video editing platforms.

**Header Navigation:**  
- At the top, a white navbar with clear, spaced tabs: Home (selected), Gallery, Analysis, Templates, Upload, Preview.  
- “Skify” logo or name on the far left.  
- “AI Video Transform” as a small tagline.

**Main Section:**  
- Large bold heading: “Transform Your Video with AI” in bright blue or purple, centered.  
- Subtext: “Upload any viral video and instantly extract its style, effects, and magic. Apply those styles to your own content with AI-powered precision.”  
- Two centered CTAs:  
  - “Upload Viral Video” (solid black button)
  - “Browse Gallery” (white outlined button)

**Three Feature Cards:**  
- Arranged horizontally (or in a row under the header if mobile):  
  - **AI Style Analysis:** Icon of a spark/bolt, with text: “Advanced AI extracts effects, transitions, color grading, and camera movements.”
  - **Template Creation:** Icon of a camera or layers, text: “Generate reusable templates from any viral video for consistent styling.”
  - **Instant Apply:** Icon of a play button, text: “Apply extracted styles to your videos with one-click transformation.”

**Sample Section:**  
- “Sample Styled Videos” heading, with a horizontal gallery showing video thumbnails, each with a title, tags, effects/icons, and an “Apply Template” button.
- Each card: a video scene still, bold title (like "Cinematic Travel Pack", "Urban Street Vibes"), effect tags (e.g., LUT, High Contrast, AI Edits), tags (#Cinematic, #Nature...), stats (like views/hearts), and “Apply Template” CTA.

**Style Gallery Screen (if requested):**  
- Grid showcasing trending templates, each card with thumbnail, labels, sample tags, and heart/favorite icon.

**Video Style Analysis Screen:**  
- Left side: video preview window (still image with play icon, timer 0:45/2:00).  
- Right: vertical list of detected effects, each with color icon (e.g., Film Grain, Color Pop), confidence slider (e.g., 92% confidence), and timestamp info.

**Template Preview Screen:**  
- Video preview box on left.
- On right, a clean color palette panel with editable color swatches (Primary, Secondary, Accent, Neutral, Background) with edit buttons.

**Upload Screen:**  
- Large upload area: “Upload your video” (icon of upload arrow), drag-drop or “Choose Video File” button.
- Supported formats, file size, and duration info.

**Preview/Export Screen:**  
- Side-by-side: Original Video (before), Styled Video (after, with “Skify Watermark” label).
- Video thumbnails above short text description (e.g., "Natural lighting", "Cinematic style applied").
- Export settings below: 4K, 1080p, 720p options.
- Download button (with watermark, free) and paid “Remove Watermark (₹49)” CTA at the bottom.

**Brand touch:**  
- Consistent minimal fonts (like Inter or Montserrat)
- Subtle shadow, rounded corners, crisp icons  
- Background: clean white or light grey
- Accent color: blue or purple for highlights

**Purpose:**  
- The interface must look like an actual, working SaaS video platform UI—crisp, inviting, and premium—ready for screenshots or product showcases.
