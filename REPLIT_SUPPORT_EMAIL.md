**Subject:** URGENT: Database Migration Platform Issue Blocking Production Deployment

---

## Issue Summary
My production deployment is failing due to a platform-level database migration issue that appears to be on Replit's infrastructure side, not related to my application code.

## Error Details
**Error Message:**
```
Database migrations could not be applied due to underlying platform issue
The deployment build completed successfully but failed during the infrastructure setup phase
Migration system encountered a platform-level error that prevents database schema updates
```

## Project Information
- **Project**: Skify AI Video Transformation Platform
- **Build Status**: Deployment build completed successfully
- **Failure Point**: Infrastructure setup phase during database migration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Migration Tool**: drizzle-kit

## Technical Context
- Application is fully functional in development environment
- Database schema is properly configured (verified via drizzle.config.ts)
- All dependencies are correctly installed
- Build process completes without errors
- Issue occurs specifically during the database migration infrastructure setup

## Impact
This is blocking our production deployment and affecting our ability to serve users. The application is production-ready from a code perspective but cannot be deployed due to this platform issue.

## Request
Please investigate and resolve the database migration platform issue affecting our deployment. We are ready to retry deployment as soon as the infrastructure issue is resolved.
