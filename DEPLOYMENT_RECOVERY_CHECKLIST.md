# Deployment Recovery Checklist

## When Platform Issue is Resolved

### Pre-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Check https://status.replit.com for "All Systems Operational"
- [ ] Verify DATABASE_URL environment variable still accessible
- [ ] Confirm application builds successfully (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Test database connection in development environment

### Deployment Attempt Steps
1. **Environment Configuration**
   - [ ] Verify all production environment variables in Deployment Secrets
   - [ ] Confirm DATABASE_URL properly configured
   - [ ] Check NODE_ENV=production setting

2. **Migration Readiness**
   - [ ] Confirm drizzle.config.ts points to correct schema
   - [ ] Verify schema.ts contains complete table definitions
   - [ ] Test `npm run db:push` in development (dry run)

3. **Deployment Execution**
   - [ ] Initiate deployment through Replit interface
   - [ ] Monitor deployment logs for successful build
   - [ ] Watch for successful database migration execution
   - [ ] Verify application startup without errors

### Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Access deployed application URL
- [ ] Test user authentication system
- [ ] Verify database operations (user signup/login)
- [ ] Test video upload and analysis features
- [ ] Confirm template system functionality
- [ ] Check payment processing endpoints

### If Deployment Still Fails
1. **Document New Issues**
   - Save complete deployment logs
   - Note specific error messages
   - Record exact failure point

2. **Support Re-engagement**
   - Reference original ticket number
   - Include new deployment attempt details
   - Request escalated platform engineering review

### Success Confirmation
- [ ] Application accessible at production URL
- [ ] All core features functional
- [ ] Database operations working correctly
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Performance meets expectations

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)
- [ ] Document current deployment state
- [ ] Keep development environment unchanged
- [ ] Maintain staging database backup
- [ ] Contact support if rollback assistance needed

## Communication Plan
- [ ] Notify stakeholders of deployment attempt
- [ ] Update project documentation with results
- [ ] Share production URL when successful
- [ ] Document lessons learned for future deployments

**Purpose**: Systematic approach to deployment once platform infrastructure is restored
**Owner**: Execute when Replit confirms database migration services operational
**Success Metric**: Fully functional Skify application accessible at production URL
